The Azure DNS service provides a globally distributed and high-availability name server infrastructure for managing domain names and DNS records. Azure DNS simplifies management, ensures security, and offers scalability for your DNS needs. It’s a powerful tool for maintaining your domain names and DNS records in the cloud.
Azure Monitor helps you proactively detect and address issues before users notice them. It provides monitoring and alerting capabilities for various data sources. Azure Monitor ensures high availability, scalability, and unlimited data transfer. It’s a crucial tool for maintaining the health and performance of your Azure resources.
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) allow you to deploy and manage scalable compute resources in the cloud.
Azure Virtual Network is a service that provides the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. An instance of the service (a virtual network) enables many types of Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. These Azure resources include virtual machines (VMs).
An Azure Network Security Group (NSG) is indeed an essential Azure service. It acts as a firewall to regulate both inbound and outbound network traffic for various Azure resources within an Azure virtual network. NSGs allow you to define security rules that either permit or deny network traffic based on various criteria.
The Azure AI Bot Service simplifies building conversational AI bots. Azure AI Bot Service integrates with Power Virtual Agents, allowing multidisciplinary teams to collaboratively build bots. Extend your reach across multiple channels and languages.
